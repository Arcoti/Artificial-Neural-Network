# Artificial-Neural-Network
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch using Python and NumPy

This project aims to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch that learns to identify handwritten numbers. It will be created and trained from the MNIST Database. Ideally, there will be several layers, with the input layer having 784 neurons (28 by 28) and the output layer having 10 neurons. The hidden layers will have about 16 neurons each and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) will be used to produce a non linear function over the sigmoid function.
